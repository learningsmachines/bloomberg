  <strong>
    Simple, type-safe, "singleton" implementation.
  </strong>
  <p>
    For when your "hot module replacement" involves re-evaluating a module, but
    you don't want to actually re-evaluate a portion of it.
  </p>

```
npm install @epic-web/remember
```

## The problem

You're using a framework like Remix with
[`--manual` mode](https://remix.run/docs/en/guides/manual-mode) and
re-evaluating your modules on every change. But you have some state that you
don't want to lose between changes. For example:

- Database connections
- In-memory caches

## This solution

This was copy/paste/modified/tested from
[@jenseng's `abuse-the-platform` demo](https://github.com/jenseng/abuse-the-platform/blob/2993a7e846c95ace693ce61626fa072174c8d9c7/app/utils/singleton.ts)
(ISC). It's basically a type-safe singleton implementation that you can use to
keep state between module re-evaluations.

## Usage

```tsx
import { remember } from '@epic-web/remember'

export const prisma = remember('prisma', () => new PrismaClient())
```

Keep in mind that any changes you make within that callback will not be
reflected when the module is re-evaluated (that's the whole point). So if you
need to change the callback, then you'll need to restart your server.

The original code was written by [@jenseng](https://github.com/jenseng) and then
I modified it and published it to fit my needs.
